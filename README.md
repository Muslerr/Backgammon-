# Backgammon- Hello and welcome to my backgammon project

this is the first MERN progect i created so mistakes may occur.
to start the project run in the main terminal : ./runProjects.sh
it should start all of the services and the React website.

if the website doesn't open automatically:
you may need to open the react website in your Url (after you ran the ./runProjects.sh command) using the following  url:http://localhost:3000/.

after running it once , close the ports to reopen using the ./stopProjects.sh command and wait a couple seconds , close the terminal and try again with the open command.
